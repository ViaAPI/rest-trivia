            This is a little of a relative and manually entered "feeling based" value. It is used to categorize questions based on their difficulty levels. It takes a positive number between 1 and 10.

            The data entry personnel must decide the difficulty level. They have special instructions on tagging the difficulty level.

          minimum: 1
          maximum: 10
